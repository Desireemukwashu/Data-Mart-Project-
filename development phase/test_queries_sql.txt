-- Test case 1: Evaluating listing performance by room type
-- in this query we want to find the total number of listings and the average price per night,
-- we join the listing and payment tables for us to get the total earnings.
-- we are also able to identify the room types which are giving us the highest total sales.

-- this query extracts the host's information icluding the property listings, room type and price per night,
