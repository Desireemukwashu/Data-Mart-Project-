# Airbnb datamart project
The main aim of this project is to design a database and implement data based on a planned structure. We are able to write and test sql code while ensuring we stay aligned to the requirements of the original design. It also checks whether the database can address real life problems effectively. The process starts with creating a data dictionary, erd and requirements specification to guide the design. Afterwards, data is inserted into the database schema, and we test the queries to ensure all components work as expected.

**PROJECT STRUCTURE**

Included files:

**ERD** - used for designing the database structure, making implementation clearer and easier.

**Data dictionary** - it contains all the attributes and their data types.

**Requirements specification** - this one contains information about the requirements that tell us how to design the database.

**Schema sql** - file for creating the database and tables.

**Test queries.sql** - queries for testing the relationships and functionality of the database.

**Airbnb-Data.csv** - this is the file where all test data is stored.

**Presentation slides** - powerpoint slides with insert into, create table statements and data tables.



**INSTALLATION**

Setting it up:

1) **Prerequisites**
 
   -install MYSQL workbench here (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)

2) **Download the repository**
 
   -git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Airbnb-Database-Project.git

3) **Open schema sql**
  
   -we create the database and tables in MYSQL workbench

4) **Import data**
  
   -we import data into tables using airbnb-database-csv-file through the Table Data Import Wizard, in MYSQL workbench.

5) **Run test queries**
    
   -run test queries to verify that the relationships and structure are working properly.
