-- Test case 1: Evaluating listing performance by room type
-- in this query we want to find the total number of listings and the average price per night,
-- we join the listing and payment tables for us to get the total earnings.
-- we are also able to identify the room types which are giving us the highest total sales.

-- Test case 3: Analyzing room type performance in terms of bookings, earnings and regions
--
-- This query calculates:
-- * the average price per night for each room type,
-- * The total bookings per listing.
-- * The total earnings from payments linked to bookings and region.

-- Joins four tables: listing, booking, payment and region
-- Also helps to identify which room types yield the highest revenue.
